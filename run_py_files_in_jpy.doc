Create or Upload the .py File:

Make sure you have the Python script (.py file) that you want to run in your Jupyter environment. You can either create a new Python file in the Jupyter environment itself or upload an existing .py file.

Create a New Jupyter Notebook:

Start by creating a new Jupyter Notebook by clicking on "New" and selecting "Python 3" (or another appropriate kernel) from the dropdown menu.

Run the Script:

In a code cell within the Jupyter Notebook, you can use the %run magic command followed by the path to your Python script. The %run command allows you to run Python scripts directly from the Jupyter Notebook.

For example, if your script is named my_script.py and it's located in the same directory as your notebook, you can use the following command in a code cell:

python
Copy code
%run my_script.py
If your script is located in a different directory, provide the full or relative path to the script.

View Output:

As the script runs, any output it generates will be displayed directly in the notebook, just like when you run code cells.

It's important to note that when you use the %run magic command, the script's variables and functions will be available in the notebook's global scope, allowing you to access and manipulate them in subsequent cells.
